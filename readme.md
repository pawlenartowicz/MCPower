# MCPower

**Simple Monte Carlo power analysis for complex models.** Find the sample size you need or check if your study has enough power - even with complex models that traditional power analysis can't handle.

## Why MCPower?

**Traditional power analysis breaks down** with interactions, correlated predictors, or non-normal data. MCPower uses simulation instead of formulas - it generates thousands of datasets exactly like yours, then sees how often your analysis finds real effects.

✅ **Works with complexity**: Interactions, correlations, any distribution  
✅ **R-style formulas**: `outcome = treatment + covariate + treatment*covariate`  
✅ **Two simple commands**: Find sample size or check power  
✅ **Scenario analysis**: Test robustness under realistic conditions  
✅ **Minimal math required**: Just specify your model and effects

## Get Started in 2 Minutes

### Install
```bash
pip install mcpower
```

### Update to the latest version (every few days).
```bash
pip install --upgrade mcpower
```

### Your First Power Analysis
```python

# 0. Import installed package
import mcpower

# 1. Define your model (just like R)
model = mcpower.LinearRegression("satisfaction = treatment + motivation")

# 2. Set effect sizes (how big you expect effects to be)
model.set_effects("treatment=0.5, motivation=0.3")

# 3. Change the treatment to "binary" (people receive treatment or not).
model.set_variable_type("treatment=binary")

# 4. Find the sample size you need
model.find_sample_size(target_test="treatment", from_size=50, to_size=200)
```
**Output**: "You need N=75 for 80% power to detect the treatment effect"

That's it! 🎉

## 🎯 Scenario Analysis: Test Your Assumptions

**Real studies rarely match perfect assumptions.** MCPower's scenario analysis tests how robust your power calculations are under realistic conditions.

```python
# Test robustness with scenario analysis
model.find_sample_size(
    target_test="treatment", 
    from_size=50, to_size=300,
    scenarios=True  # 🔥 The magic happens here
)
```

**Output:**
```
SCENARIO SUMMARY
================================================================================

Uncorrected Sample Sizes:
Test                                     Optimistic   Realistic    Doomer      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
treatment                                75           85           100         
================================================================================
```

**What each scenario means:**
- **Optimistic**: Your ideal conditions (original settings)
- **Realistic**: Moderate real-world complications (small effect variations, mild assumption violations)
- **Doomer**: Conservative estimate (larger effect variations, stronger assumption violations)

**💡 Pro tip**: Use the **Realistic** scenario for planning. If **Doomer** is acceptable, you're really safe!

## Understanding Effect Sizes

**Effect sizes tell you how much the outcome changes when predictors change.**

- **Effect size = 0.5** means the outcome increases by **0.5 standard deviations** when:
  - **Continuous variables**: Predictor increases by 1 standard deviation  
  - **Binary variables**: Predictor changes from 0 to 1 (e.g., control → treatment)

**Practical examples:**
```python
model.set_effects("treatment=0.5, age=0.3, income=0.2")
```

- **`treatment=0.5`**: Treatment increases outcome by 0.5 SD (medium-large effect)
- **`age=0.3`**: Each 1 SD increase in age → 0.3 SD increase in outcome  
- **`income=0.2`**: Each 1 SD increase in income → 0.2 SD increase in outcome

**Effect size guidelines:**
- **0.1** = Small effect (detectable but modest)
- **0.25** = Medium effect (clearly noticeable) 
- **0.4** = Large effect (substantial impact)

**Effect size guidelines (binary variables):**
- **0.2** = Small effect (detectable but modest)
- **0.5** = Medium effect (clearly noticeable) 
- **0.8** = Large effect (substantial impact)

**Your uploaded data is automatically standardized** (mean=0, SD=1) so effect sizes work the same way whether you use synthetic or real data.

## Copy-Paste Examples for Common Studies

### Randomized Controlled Trial
```python
import mcpower

# RCT with treatment + control variables
model = mcpower.LinearRegression("outcome = treatment + age + baseline_score")
model.set_effects("treatment=0.6, age=0.2, baseline_score=0.8")
model.set_variable_type("treatment=binary")  # 0/1 treatment

# Find sample size for treatment effect with scenario analysis
model.find_sample_size(target_test="treatment", from_size=100, to_size=500, 
                      by=50, scenarios=True)
```

### A/B Test with Interaction
```python
import mcpower

# Test if treatment effect depends on user type
model = mcpower.LinearRegression("conversion = treatment + user_type + treatment*user_type")
model.set_effects("treatment=0.4, user_type=0.3, treatment:user_type=0.5")
model.set_variable_type("treatment=binary, user_type=binary")

# Check power robustness for the interaction
model.find_power(sample_size=400, target_test="treatment:user_type", scenarios=True)
```

### Survey with Correlated Predictors
```python
import mcpower

# Predictors are often correlated in real data
model = mcpower.LinearRegression("wellbeing = income + education + social_support")
model.set_effects("income=0.4, education=0.3, social_support=0.6")
model.set_correlations("corr(income, education)=0.5, corr(income, social_support)=0.3")

# Find sample size for any effect
model.find_sample_size(target_test="all", from_size=200, to_size=800, 
                      by=100, scenarios=True)
```

## Customize for Your Study

### Different Variable Types
```python
# Binary (0/1), skewed, or other distributions
model.set_variable_type("treatment=binary, income=right_skewed, age=normal")

# Binary with custom proportions (30% get treatment)
model.set_variable_type("treatment=(binary,0.3)")
```

### Your Own Data (be careful, not yet well tested)
```python
import pandas as pd

# Use your pilot data for realistic simulations
df = pd.read_csv('examples/cars.csv')
model.upload_own_data(df)  # Automatically preserves correlations
```

### Multiple Testing
```python
# Testing multiple effects? Control false positives
model.find_power(
    sample_size=200, 
    target_test="treatment,covariate,treatment:covariate",
    correction="Benjamini-Hochberg",
    scenarios=True  # Test robustness too!
)
```

### Test the single violation of assumptions.
```python
# Customize how much "messiness" to add in scenarios
model.set_heterogeneity(0.2)        # Effect sizes vary between people
model.set_heteroskedasticity(0.15)  # Violation of equal variance assumption

# Then run scenario analysis
model.find_sample_size(target_test="treatment", scenarios=False)
```

### More precision
```python
# To make a more precise estimation, consider increasing the number of simulations.
model.set_simulations(10000)

# MCPower is already heavily optimized, but there is old code that allows for parallelization. Use it to speed up your largest simulations.
model.set_parallel(True)

```

## Quick Reference

| **Want to...** | **Use this** |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Find required sample size | `model.find_sample_size(target_test="effect_name")` |
| Check power for specific N | `model.find_power(sample_size=150, target_test="effect_name")` |
| **Test robustness** | **Add `scenarios=True` to either method** |
| Test overall model | `target_test="overall"` |
| Test multiple effects | `target_test="effect1, effect2"` or `"all"` |
| Binary variables | `model.set_variable_type("var=binary")` |
| Correlated predictors | `model.set_correlations("corr(var1, var2)=0.4")` |
| Multiple testing correction | Add `correction="FDR", or "Holm" pr "Bonferroni"`|

## When to Use MCPower

**✅ Use MCPower when you have:**
- Interaction terms (`treatment*covariate`)
- Binary or non-normal variables
- Correlated predictors
- Multiple effects to test
- **Need to test assumption robustness**
- Complex models where traditional power analysis fails

**✅ Use Scenario Analysis when:**
- Planning important studies (grants, dissertations)
- Working with messy real-world data
- Effect sizes are uncertain
- Want conservative sample size estimates
- Stakeholders need confidence in your numbers

**❌ Use traditional power analysis for:**
- For models that are not yet implemented
- When all assumptions are clearly met

## What Makes Scenarios Different? (Be careful, unvalidated, preliminary scenarios)

**Traditional power analysis assumes perfect conditions.** MCPower's scenarios add realistic "messiness":

| **Scenario** | **What's Different** | **When to Use** |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Optimistic** | Your exact settings | Best-case planning |
| **Realistic** | Mild effect variations, small assumption violations | **Recommended for most studies** |
| **Doomer** | Larger effect variations, stronger assumption violations | Conservative/worst-case planning |

**Behind the scenes**, scenarios randomly vary:
- Effect sizes between participants
- Correlation strengths  
- Variable distributions
- Assumption violations

This gives you a **range of realistic outcomes** instead of a single optimistic estimate.
⚠️ **Important**: Scenario analysis and uploaded data features are experimental. 
Use with caution for critical decisions.
