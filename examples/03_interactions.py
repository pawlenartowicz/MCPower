Interactions Analysis Example
=============================

This example demonstrates how to analyze interaction effects - when the effect
of one variable depends on the level of another variable.

    """
Key insights about interactions:

1. SAMPLE SIZE: Interactions need larger samples than main effects
   - 2-way interactions: ~2-4x larger N
   - 3-way interactions: ~4-8x larger N

2. EFFECT SIZES: Interaction effects are often smaller
   - Main effects: 0.3-0.8 typical
   - Interactions: 0.1-0.4 typical

3. INTERPRETATION: 
   - Significant interaction = effect varies by subgroup
   - Use scenarios=True for robust planning
   - Consider if interaction is theoretically meaningful

4. DESIGN TIPS:
   - Balance groups when possible
   - Pre-register interaction hypotheses
   - You could include interaction you are not sure, 
      loss in overall power is small at worst
      
5. ATTENTION!
   - Most variablity in power for replication is from correlation (next example)
